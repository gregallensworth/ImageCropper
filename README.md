# ImageCropper

This jQuery plugin makes it copy-paste simple to add an image-cropping tool to your website.

It attaches to a *input[type="file"]* element, then intercepts *change* events to capture the image content file. It loads the image into a utility for the user to zoom in and crop, then saves the resulting base64-encoded JPEG to a *input[type="text"]* element _with the same name, replacing the file upload content_.

If that wasn't clear, just head over to the demo and check it out.

# Why This One

This specific adaptation of a file-to-Base64 converter, is being developed because it fits our needs quite well. it ties to a file upload element, provides a lightweight interface that is not particularly dependent on page layout and elements, and provides documented CSS classes for custom styling. For our needs at work, this is just perfect.

# Credits

A lot of the "heavy lifting" workflow, was adapted from the following gist by "ezgoing" dated September 14 2014. http://cssdeck.com/labs/xnmcokhc

My own work in this initial adaptation was focused on:
* having the HTML generated by the ImageCropper() so as to reduce the HTML-pasting overhead
* internal documentation/ /comments and cleanup
* some event-binding fixes when running multiple instances of ImageCropper on one page
